## Toddler Roku Remote

This project was designed for my son who is 26 months. 
He is incapable of using a traditional remote at this age,
so we are utilizing ROKU's ECP (External Control Protocol)

We **strongly encourage** a Youtube Premium account to avoid ads.

It was also important to us to be able to curate his content more.
Youtube Kids provided a very poor interface, extremely short videos, bad new content suggestions, and little variety in selection.
It also limited us to a tablet as oppossed to TV. This level of empowerment allows him to learn at his own pace, with content we manually approve.

In addition to NEEDING a roku device / tv, it is also **highly recommended** to utilize Guided Access on
Apple devices or some other means of screen control to prevent exiting the web browser.
