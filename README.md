## Toddler Roku Remote

This project was designed for my son who is 26 months. 
He is incapable of using a traditional remote at this age,
so we are utilizing ROKU's ECP (External Control Protocol)

[Roku ECP Docs](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md)

In addition to NEEDING a roku device / tv, it is also **highly recommended** to utilize Guided Access on
Apple devices or some other means of screen control to prevent exiting the web browser.
